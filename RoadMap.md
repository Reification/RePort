RePort is a slice of [Reification's](https://reification.io) codebase. As we progress through the roadmap, additional parts of our private codebase will be made public.

We hope that this project will remove barries (both financial and technical) to experiencing architectural creations and ideas.

Presently, the project only includes a custom exporter for Rhino. Other exporters will be added as opportunity permits.

## Will you be adding support for other CAD/BIM applications?
Yes. Applications will be added to the roadmap when support plans are finalized. If you would like to see a specific application supported, [please let us know.](mailto:support@reification.io)

## Why does RePort use deprecated lighting and XR systems?
In both of these cases Unity has chosen to deprecate a system without providing an equally capable alternative. In the case of Enlighten, the built in alternative (Unityâ€™s Progressive lightmapper) will not update bounced lighting as the sun moves. In the case of the Virtual Reality SDKs, the replacement (XR Plugin Management) does not support SteamVR. We will be assessing new solutions as they become available.
